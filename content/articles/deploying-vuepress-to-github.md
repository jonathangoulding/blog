# Deploying a vuepress site to GitHub Pages

I wanted to explore Github actions and understand how to deploy a website that has a
build step.
I had read a few tutorial that did some complicated things. Some even required
multiple 'marketplace' actions.
This seemed too complicated. So i tried to make it work with just a GitHub action
and config for my <a href="https://github.com/jonathangoulding/vuepress-docs-example"> Vuepress Doc
Example</a> repo.
