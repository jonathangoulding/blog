title: Using a Domain for side projects
description: Why use a domain for side projects
---

I use the <a href="https://demonicfridge.com/">demonicfridge.com</a> domain for my
side projects that require a domain name.

Having a domain name makes working with deployemnts easier to setup and test.
For example [securing nginx with let's encrypt](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04)
