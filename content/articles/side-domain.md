# Using a Domain for side projects

I use the <a href="https://demonicfridge.com/">demonicfridge.com</a> domain for my
side projects that require a domain name.
I find just having the domain makes things easier to develop and test.
For example [securing nginx with let's encrypt](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04)
